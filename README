Experiment with prefetching in a case where the typical prefetching
behavior might be inadequate - i.e. the programmer knows a lot more about
the access pattern then the cache.  Here the access pattern is fibonacci
numbers - mod the size of the working set.

Might want to pretty this up for more tests.

Results with working set of 1G, 50000000 iterations:
CPU time w/o prefetching: 6.919791s
CPU time prefetching 32 ahead: 3.671016s
